# General Info
I created my own portfolio to show what I have learned so far at bootcamp, I used html and css code.
The website contains information about me, what I have learned so far or what I will learn at the bootcamp, and my contact details.
My motivation was to show what I can do and what I learned on this course, I also intend to improve this portfolio after acquiring more skills.
